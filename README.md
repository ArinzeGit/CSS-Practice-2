# CSS Practice 2

This project contains a table that responds to hover and click, a fixed button, audio, iframe and a CSS design using Flexbox. I used this project to practice HTML iframe element, CSS Flexbox, HTML tables, HTML audio elements and HTML pseudo-class.

* Open the index.html file in your web browser
* The project should now be visible in your browser
## Technologies used

## Challenges faced during development
* The iframe could not display webpages from a lot of websites
  * I learnt that a lot of websites do not authorize their pages to be displayed in an iframe
